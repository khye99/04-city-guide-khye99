      the cradle of  the Renaissance, Florence gives its people beauty, history,
      and culture. Here are the top 5 places you should visit when planning a trip

  The Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore is the main church
  of Florence, Italy. The Duomo, as it is ordinarily called, was
  begun in 1296 in the Gothic style with the design of Arnolfo
  di Cambio and compleded structurally almost 150 years later in
  1436. The Duomo is considered to be one of the world's greatest
  churches and is the top tourist destination in Florence.

    </div>
The wonders of this city are contained, as in a treasure chest,
in its fabulous museums: each museum is a window on the
Italian art, history and culture, an endless source of knowledge
and beauty! The Uffizi Gallery & Galleria dell'Accademia are two
of Florence's most prominent destinations to enrich yourself with
something truly special.
The Uffizi Gallery (or Galleria degli Uffizi, in Italian) is the most famous museum
in Florence, and one of the most famous and important museums in the world.
The Accademia Gallery in Florence is also called the Museum of Michelangelo.
Created by the Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo in 1784 as a place of study for students
of the nearby Academy of Fine Arts (Accademia di Belle Arti) which  was the first
 academy of drawning in Europe, the Accademy Gallery (Galleria dell'Accademia)
  in Florence today retains some of the most beautiful works of Michelangelo, such
  as the famous "David".

A Travellers' Choice 2012 Winner Restaurant, this spot is a stones throw
from Palazzo Vechio and serves traditional fare from a blackboard menu
under wood beamed ceilings. Not only is it rated by hordes of Trip Advisor fans,
it is also recommended in a very Italian, very unpretentious food guide Il
Mangiarozzo (more listings from this guide below). Reservations are mandatory.
A small gem in the center of town, you will be able to taste some of the best
typical local food around. This place truly defines the heart of Italy.

Whether you are looking for an activity for the whole family, a Tuscan meal,
hunting for those local ingredients to try your hands at a Florentine dish or for
a souvenir to bring home, the San Lorenzo Market is the place for you. The
market is actually comprised of two separate markets, an indoor market, known
as the Mercato Centrale, or Central Market, is home to all things food. The
outdoor section that lines the surroundings streets of the large Mercato Centrale
building, sells leather, clothing, and many other souvenirs. Both the outdoor
and indoor markets are a great addition to your sightseeing and to the
 museum visits you have on your itinerary (especially if you need a break from
 museums in Florence) so make sure to set a whole morning aside to explore the market,
 and shop until your heart's content.

 <h5 class="first"> <a id="section5">5. Ponte Vecchio</a></h5>
   <div>
       <img src="ponte.jpg" alt="Ponte Vecchio" style="width:800px; height:450px">
   </div>
The Ponte Vecchio is the oldest bridge in Florence. It is believed that a bridge
already existed here during the Roman times. Its current appearance dates back
to 1345 when it was built to replace a bridge which was destroyed by a flood.
Houses were built on the bridge, a common practice in large European cities
during the Middle Ages. This pedestrian bridge is often teeming with tourists
and the many musicians, portraitists, and other entertainers who create a constantly
vibrant atmosphere. The bridge is at its most beautiful at dusk, especially when
seen from the Ponte Santa Trinit√†. The lights reflect in the water like falling
golden stardust, perfect for taking that golden picture!
